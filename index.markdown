## Hi! I'm Aditya.

I'm currently a PhD student in the EECS department at MIT. Before that, I've conducted research at Duke as an undergraduate and Princeton University as a summer intern. My research focuses on quantum engineering; how can we use basic physical science to design the next generation of sensors, networks, and computers?

### Research

My research has largely focused on quantum computing and quantum engineering, specifically in atomic systems. At Duke, my work focuses on using computational optimization methods to find best practices for sympathetic cooling of trapped ions. At Princeton, I designed, built, and characterized optical modulators to generate large-scale focus arrays for neutral-atom trapping and quantum computation.

### Miscellanea

Outside of the lab, I love television shows and food. I especially love ranking things as a general practice; I maintain spreadsheets of my favorite TV shows and restaurants and either rank or rate them. My latest watch has been Barry on HBO.

This website is a work in progress! I'm using Jekyll's `minima` theme, and heavy inspiration was drawn from [Lukas Lehner's](https://lukaslehner.github.io) website.
